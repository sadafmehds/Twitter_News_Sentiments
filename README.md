#Distinguishing Sentiments

**Twitter** has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out _per day_. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it is attempted to concisely capture the essence of different media outlets' news tweets in terms of tone/polarity/sentiments of the language used.

## News Mood

Selected news organizations: **BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times**.

* Analysis of the last **100** tweets sent out by each news organization: polarity ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, where a score of 0 expresses a neutral sentiment, -1 the most negative sentiment possible, and +1 the most positive sentiment possible

* _overall_ sentiments of the last 100 tweets from each organization.
